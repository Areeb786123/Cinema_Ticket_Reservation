# Cinema Ticket App

This is a Cinema Ticket App design implemented using Jetpack Compose. The design concept was originally created by Bogdan Nikitin and can be found on Dribbble [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/18133523-Movie-Tickets-Mobile-App). 

I have successfully replicated and developed the design using Jetpack Compose and Figma. The Figma link to the replicated design can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/3eWf9DgV4gw1k9Np81Y0LF/Cinema-Ticket-App?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=T1GdF2LvswlRXIka-1).
